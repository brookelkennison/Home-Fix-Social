<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Ever taken on a task of tackling a home project that you knew nothing about and knew no one that could answer all of your many questions? This app is for you. This instant messaging platform can provide you with the answers to your questions in a matter of seconds from other DIY home project tacklers. I'm determined to figure this out together!

My inspiration:
* In early 2021 I purchased a 1952 ranch style home. This home needed a lot of work, and I was determined to renovate it with my own two hands.
* Youtube was the source of the answers to my questions, but when they didn't answer my questions I had no one to ask for advice when I needed the answer within a few minutes.


A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
